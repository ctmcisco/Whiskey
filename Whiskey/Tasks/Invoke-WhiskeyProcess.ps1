    .SYNOPSIS
    Runs a process\executable.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Process` task runs a process/executable. Specify the path to the executable to run with the task's `Path` property. The `Path` can be the name of an executable that can be found in the `PATH` environment variable, a path relative to your `whiskey.yml` file's directory, or an absolute path.

    The task will fail if the process returns a non-zero exit code. Use the `SuccessExitCode` property to configure the task to interpret other exit codes as "success". 

    Pass arguments to the process via the `Argument` property. The `Process` task uses PowerShell's `Start-Process` cmdlet to run the process, so that arguments will be passes as-is, with no escaping. YAML strings, however, are usually single-quoted (e.g. `'Value'`) or double-quoted (e.g. `"Value"`). If you're using a single quoted string and need to insert a single quote, escape it by using two single quotes, e.g. `'escape: '''` is converted to `escape '`. If you're using a double-quoted string and need to insert a double quote, escape it with `\`, e.g. `"escape: \""` is converted to `escape: "`. YAML supports other escape sequences in double-quoted strings. The full list of escape sequences is in the [YAML specification](http://yaml.org/spec/current.html#escaping in double quoted style/).

    By default, the executable is run from your `whiskey.yml` file's directory (i.e. the build root). Change the working directory with the `WorkingDirectory` property.

    # Properties

    * `Path` (*mandatory*): the path to the executable to run. This can be the name of an executable if it is in your PATH environment variable, a path relative to the `whiskey.yml` file, or an absolute path.
    * `Argument`: a list of arguments to pass to the executable. Read the documentation above for notes on how to properly escape arguments.
    * `WorkingDirectory`: the directory the executable will run in/from. By default, this is the build root, i.e. the `whiskey.yml` file's directory.
    * `SuccessExitCode`: a list of exit codes that the `Process` task should interpret to mean the process exited successfully. The default is `0`.

    # Examples

    ## Example 1

            BuildTasks:
            - Process:
                Path: cmd.exe
                Argument:
                - /C
                - dir C:\

    This example demonstrates how to call an executable whose arguments have to be quoted a specific way. In this case, we're using `cmd.exe` to get a directory listing of the `C:\` directory. This example will run `cmd.exe /C dir C:\.

    ## Example 2

            BuildTasks:
            - Process:
                Path: robocopy.exe
                Argument:
                - C:\Source
                - C:\Desitination
                - /MIR    
                SuccessExitCode:
                - 0
                - 1
                - 2
                - 3
                - 4
                - 5
                - 6
                - 7

    This example demonstrates how to configure the `Process` task to fail when an executable can return multiple success exit codes. In this case, `robocopy.exe` can return any value less than 8 to report a successful copy.
