SUMMARY
    Runs tasks in parallel.

DESCRIPTION
    The `Parallel` task runs other tasks in parallel/asynchronously. It waits until each task finishes. As each task finishes, it emits its output. If a task fails, the other remaining tasks are cancelled. Specify what tasks to run under a `Task` property.

PROPERTIES
    * `Task`: a list of tasks to run. Tasks are defined here just like they are defined under a pipeline.

EXAMPLES
    Example 1

        BuildTasks:
        - Parallel:
            Task:
                NUnit2:
                    DisableCodeCoverage: true
                    Path: myassembly.dll
                NUnit2:
                    DisableCodeCoverage: true
                    Path: myassembly2.dll
                NUnit2:
                    DisableCodeCoverage: true
                    Path: myassembly3.dll

    Demonstrates how to run tasks in parallel. In this example, three NUnit tests will be run at the same time.
